-----------------------------------

This is my fork of xv6 which is re-implementation of UnixV6 for RISC-V and used as teaching operation system at MIT.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu. Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
